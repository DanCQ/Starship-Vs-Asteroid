            <h1>Sun</h1>

            <h3>DATA:</h3>

            <p>Star Type: Yellow Dwarf</p>

            <p>Age: 4.5 billion years</p>

            <p>Orbital Distance: 26,000 light years from galactic center</p>

            <p>Orbital Period: 230 million years around the Milky Way</p>

            <p>Atmospheric Temperature: 3.5 million °F | 2 million °C</p>

            <p>Radius: 435,000 miles | 700,000 km</p>

            <p>Surface Gravity: 899.0ft/s<sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>Escape Velocity: 1,381,756mph</p>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>A hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. Orbiting the galactic center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, or one astronomical unit (AU).</p>

            <p>The largest object in our solar system. Its volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit. Orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and three trillion comets and icy bodies.</p>

            <p>Planets in its orbit: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.</p>

            <p>The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). Hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.</p>

            <p>Made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days.</p>

            <p>The Sun generates magnetic fields, solar radiation, that extend out into space to form the interplanetary magnetic field - the magnetic field that pervades our solar system. The field is carried through the solar system by the solar wind - a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The vast bubble of space dominated by the Sun's magnetic field is called the heliosphere.</p>

        <div class="info-earth info">

            <h1>Earth</h1>

            <h3>DATA:</h3>

            <p>Planet Type: Terrestrial</p>

            <p>Moons: 1</p>

            <p>Orbital Distance: 1 AU — average 93 million miles | 150 million kilometers</p>

            <p>Orbital Period: 365.25 days</p>

            <p>Day: 23.9 hours</p>

            <p>Average Surface Temperature: 57 °F | 13.9 °C</p>

            <p>Radius: 3,959 miles | 6,371 kilometers</p>

            <p>Surface Gravity: 32.041ft/s<sup>2</sup></p>

            <p>Escape Velocity: 25,031mph</p>

            <p>Atmospheric Constituents: Nitrogen, Oxygen</p>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>Third planet orbiting the Sun. The fifth largest planet in the solar system. Our home planet. Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. The only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. 70% of the planet is covered in water.</p>

            <p>Except for Earth, all the planets were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>

            <p>Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other ingredients. The atmosphere protects the planet from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in the atmosphere before they can strike the surface. The atmosphere shields the planet from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun.</p>

            <p>One astronomical unit (AU) away from the Sun. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes the yearly cycle of seasons. When spring and fall begin, both northern and southern hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.</p>

            <p>The only planet in the solar system with a single moon. The moon stabilizes the planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years. Earth's oceans provided a place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.</p>

            <p>Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and crust.</p>

            <p>The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals, with a temperature as high as 9,800 °F | 5,400 °C. The outer core is made of iron and nickel fluids, and is surrounded by the mantle, the thickest layer, a hot viscous mixture of molten rock. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 km) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 km) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.</p>

            <p>Earth's lithosphere, composed of the crust and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.</p>

        <div class="info-aurora info">

            <h1>Aurora Borealis</h1>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>The aurora borealis, are beautiful dancing waves of light whose occurrence is due to energized particles from the Sun, called the solar wind, slamming into Earth's upper atmosphere, or ionosphere, at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph).</p>

            <p>The planet's magnetic field protects it from the onslaught. In the Northern Hemisphere, the phenomenon is called the northern lights (aurora borealis), while in the Southern Hemisphere, it's called the southern lights (aurora australis).</p>

            <p>Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei gave them the name "aurora borealis" in 1619 — after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun. And the Greek god of the north wind, Boreas. In Roman mythology, Auster is the god of the south wind.</p> 

            <p>Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland theorized that electrons emitted from sunspots produced the atmospheric lights after being guided toward the poles by Earth's magnetic field. The theory would eventually prove correct.</p>

            <p>The earth's magnetic field is weaker at either pole and therefore some particles enter the earth's atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light that we perceive as the dancing lights. The lights of the Aurora generally extend from 80 km (50 miles) to as high as 640 km (400 miles) above the earth's surface.</p>

            <p>Every type of atom or molecule, whether it's atomic hydrogen or a molecule like carbon dioxide, absorbs and radiates its own unique set of colors. Some of the dominant colors seen in aurorae are red, a hue produced by the nitrogen molecules, and green, which is produced by oxygen molecules.</p>

            <p>The best places to watch the lights are in the northwestern parts of Canada, particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Alaska. Auroral displays can also be seen over the southern tip of Greenland and Iceland, the northern coast of Norway and over the coastal waters north of Siberia. Southern auroras are not often seen as they are concentrated in a ring around Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean.</p>

            <p>Auroras have been seen in the atmospheres of all the gas giant planets, these planets all have robust magnetic fields. Auroras have also been discovered on both Venus and Mars, both of which have very weak magnetic fields.</p>
