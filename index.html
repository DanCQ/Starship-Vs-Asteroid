            <h1>Aurora Borealis</h1>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>The aurora borealis, are beautiful dancing waves of light whose occurrence is due to energized particles from the Sun, called the solar wind, slamming into Earth's upper atmosphere, or ionosphere, at speeds of up to 45 million mph (72 million kph).</p>

            <p>The planet's magnetic field protects it from the onslaught. In the Northern Hemisphere, the phenomenon is called the northern lights (aurora borealis), while in the Southern Hemisphere, it's called the southern lights (aurora australis).</p>

            <p>Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei gave them the name "aurora borealis" in 1619 — after the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, who travelled from east to west announcing the coming of the sun. And the Greek god of the north wind, Boreas. In Roman mythology, Auster is the god of the south wind.</p> 

            <p>Norwegian scientist Kristian Birkeland theorized that electrons emitted from sunspots produced the atmospheric lights after being guided toward the poles by Earth's magnetic field. The theory would eventually prove correct.</p>

            <p>The earth's magnetic field is weaker at either pole and therefore some particles enter the earth's atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light that we perceive as the dancing lights. The lights of the Aurora generally extend from 80 km (50 miles) to as high as 640 km (400 miles) above the earth's surface.</p>

            <p>Every type of atom or molecule, whether it's atomic hydrogen or a molecule like carbon dioxide, absorbs and radiates its own unique set of colors. Some of the dominant colors seen in aurorae are red, a hue produced by the nitrogen molecules, and green, which is produced by oxygen molecules.</p>

            <p>The best places to watch the lights are in the northwestern parts of Canada, particularly the Yukon, Nunavut, Northwest Territories and Alaska. Auroral displays can also be seen over the southern tip of Greenland and Iceland, the northern coast of Norway and over the coastal waters north of Siberia. Southern auroras are not often seen as they are concentrated in a ring around Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean.</p>

            <p>Auroras have been seen in the atmospheres of all the gas giant planets, these planets all have robust magnetic fields. Auroras have also been discovered on both Venus and Mars, both of which have very weak magnetic fields.</p>

            <p>Atmospheric Constituents: Nitrogen, Oxygen</p>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>Third planet orbiting the Sun. The fifth largest planet in the solar system. Our home planet. Earth is a rocky planet with a solid and dynamic surface of mountains, canyons, plains and more. The only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. 70% of the planet is covered in water.</p>

            <p>Except for Earth, all the planets were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.”</p>

            <p>Earth's atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 1% other ingredients. The atmosphere protects the planet from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in the atmosphere before they can strike the surface. The atmosphere shields the planet from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun.</p>

            <p>One astronomical unit (AU) away from the Sun. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes the yearly cycle of seasons. When spring and fall begin, both northern and southern hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.</p>

            <p>The only planet in the solar system with a single moon. The moon stabilizes the planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years. Earth's oceans provided a place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.</p>

            <p>Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet's center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and crust.</p>

            <p>The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals, with a temperature as high as 9,800 °F | 5,400 °C. The outer core is made of iron and nickel fluids, and is surrounded by the mantle, the thickest layer, a hot viscous mixture of molten rock. The outermost layer, Earth's crust, goes about 19 miles (30 km) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 km) from the seafloor to the top of the mantle.</p>

            <p>Earth's lithosphere, composed of the crust and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate.</p>

            <p>Atmospheric Constituents: Carbon Dioxide, Nitrogen, Argon</p>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>Fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth. A dusty, cold, desert world with a very thin atmosphere. Mars is also a dynamic planet with seasons, polar ice caps, canyons, extinct volcanoes, and evidence that it was even more active in the past. Its surface has nearly the same area as Earth's dry land.</p>

            <p>Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. In the night sky it looks like a bright red point of light. Today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.</p>

            <p>Martian days are called sols - short for "solar day." Mars' axis of rotation is tilted 25 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. Mars has distinct seasons, but they last longer than seasons on Earth and vary in length because of Mars' elliptical, egg-shaped and more distant orbit around the Sun.</p>

            <p>Spring in the northern hemisphere (autumn in the southern) is the longest season at 194 sols. Autumn in the northern hemisphere (spring in the southern) is the shortest at 142 sols. Northern winter/southern summer is 154 sols, and northern summer/southern winter is 178 sols.</p>

            <p>Mars has evidence of ancient river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago. Water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls. The Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface.</p> 

            <p>Mars has a thin atmosphere, and heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids, and comets. Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.</p>

            <p>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 °F | 20 °C or as low as about -225 °F | -153 °C. Because the atmosphere is so thin, if you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet 75 °F | 24 °C  and winter at your head 32 °F | 0 °C.</p>

            <p>Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured asteroids. They're potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity to make them spherical. The moons get their names from the horses that pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares. Phobos, the innermost and larger moon, is slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about 50 million years.</p>

            <p>Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 mi (1,500 to 2,100 km) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel, and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 mi (1,240 to 1,880 km) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 mi (10 to 50 km) deep. Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized.</p>

            <p>Despite being inhospitable to humans, an international team of robotic explorers are serving as pathfinders to eventually get humans to the surface of the Red Planet.</p>

            <p>Atmospheric Constituents: Near vacuum</p>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>The fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets and asteroids in our solar system. The Moon is less than a third of the width of Earth. Earth's only natural satellite, simply called "the Moon”, because until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610, people didn't know other moons existed.</p>

            <p>The brightest and largest object in our night sky. The Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis, leading to a relatively stable climate. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth. Long ago the Moon had active volcanoes, but today they are all dormant and have not erupted for millions of years. The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth, by about an inch every year.</p>

            <p>Tidally locked, the Moon is rotating at the same rate that it revolves around Earth (synchronous rotation). The rotations are so in sync that we only see one side of the Moon. We didn't see the lunar far side until a Soviet spacecraft flew past in 1959. An international law written in 1967 prevents any nation from owning planets, stars, or any other natural objects in space.</p>

            <p>The Moon has a solid, rocky surface cratered and pitted from impacts by asteroids, meteorites, and comets. Its atmosphere, called an exosphere, is very thin, does not provide any protection from the Sun's radiation, and is not breathable. 24 astronauts have traveled to the Moon, of those, 12 have walked on its surface. More than 105 robotic spacecraft have been launched to explore the Moon. Nearly the entire Moon is covered by a charcoal-gray, powdery dust, and rocky debris called the lunar regolith. Beneath is a region of fractured bedrock referred to as the megaregolith. Apollo astronauts brought back a total of 842 pounds (382 kg) of lunar rocks and soil to Earth, that are still being studied.</p>

            <p>The light areas of the Moon are known as the highlands. The dark features, called maria (Latin for seas), are impact basins that were filled with lava between 4.2 and 1.2 billion years ago. These light and dark areas represent rocks of different compositions and ages, which provide evidence for how the early crust may have crystallized from a lunar magma ocean.</p>

            <p>The first definitive discovery of water was made in 2008 by the Indian mission Chandrayaan-1, which detected hydroxyl molecules spread across the lunar surface and concentrated at the poles. Missions such as Lunar Prospector, LCROSS, and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, have not only shown that the surface of the Moon has global hydration but there are actually high concentrations of ice water in the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar poles. This makes the Moon a little more hospitable for future human colonists.</p>

            <p>The temperature on the Moon reaches about 260 degrees Fahrenheit (127 degrees Celsius) when in full Sun, but in darkness, the temperatures plummet to about -280 degrees Fahrenheit (-173 degrees Celsius).</p>

            <p>The Moon's solid iron-rich inner core is 149 mi (240 km) in radius, surrounded by a liquid iron shell 56 mi (90 km) thick, surrounded by a partial molten layer with a thickness of 93 mi (150 km). The mantle extends from the top of the partially molten layer to the bottom of the Moon's crust. It is most likely made of minerals like olivine and pyroxene, which are made up of magnesium, iron, silicon, and oxygen atoms. The crust has a thickness of about 43 mi (70 km) on the Moon's near-side hemisphere and 93 mi (150 km) on the far-side. It is made of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, and aluminum, with small amounts of titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen.</p>

            <h3>ANALYSIS:</h3>

            <p>A hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun, along with our solar system, orbits the galactic center of the Milky Way Galaxy, at an average velocity of 450,000 mph | 720,000 kph, in a spiral arm called the Orion Spur that extends outward from the Sagittarius arm.</p>
            
            <p>The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, or one astronomical unit (AU). The largest object in our solar system. Its volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds everything from the biggest planets to tiny debris in its orbit. Orbited by eight planets, at least five dwarf planets, tens of thousands of asteroids, and three trillion comets and icy bodies.</p>

            <p>The planets in its orbit are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The dwarf planets Pluto, Ceres, Makemake, Haumea, and Eris.</p>

            <p>The Sun has been called by many names. The Latin word for Sun is “sol,” which is the main adjective for all things Sun-related: solar. Helios, the Sun god in ancient Greek mythology, lends his name to many Sun-related terms as well, such as heliosphere and helioseismology.</p>

            <p>Our Sun is an average star in terms of its size. Stars up to 100 times larger have been found. And many solar systems have more than one star. By studying our Sun, scientists can better understand the workings of distant stars.</p>

            <p>The Sun formed about 4.6 billion years ago in a giant, spinning cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. As the nebula collapsed under its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a disk. Most of the nebula's material was pulled toward the center to form our Sun, which accounts for 99.8% of our solar system's mass. Much of the remaining material formed the planets and other objects that now orbit the Sun.</p>

            <p>Like all stars, the Sun will eventually run out of energy. When it starts to die, the Sun will expand into a red giant star, becoming so large that it will engulf Mercury and Venus, and possibly Earth as well. Scientists predict the Sun is a little less than halfway through its lifetime and will last another 5 billion years or so before it becomes a white dwarf.</p>

            <p>Made of super-hot, electrically charged gas called plasma. This plasma rotates at different speeds on different parts of the Sun. At its equator, the Sun completes one rotation in 25 Earth days. At its poles, the Sun rotates once on its axis every 36 Earth days. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million °F | 15 million °C. Hot enough to sustain nuclear fusion. This creates outward pressure that supports the star's gigantic mass, keeping it from collapsing.</p>

            <p>The Sun generates magnetic fields, solar radiation, that extend out into space to form the interplanetary magnetic field - the magnetic field that pervades our solar system. The field is carried through the solar system by the solar wind - a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all directions. The vast bubble of space dominated by the Sun's magnetic field is called the heliosphere.</p>
        
            <p>Its nearest stellar neighbor is the Alpha Centauri triple star system: red dwarf star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light-years away, and Alpha Centauri A and B - two sunlike stars orbiting each other - are 4.37 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year, which equals about 6 trillion mi (9.5 trillion km).</p>
